NOTE: in order for you to be able to work with this project you need environment variables. You have to install <npm i dotenv> and create two files each one for a separate db (one for dev and one for testing). Use the format ".env.test.js/.env.development.js" and add the database. Once you do that, add the env files to gitignore.  You can now successfully connect to the two databases locally.
